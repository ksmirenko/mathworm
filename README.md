The MathWorm - a tiny Android application containing some mathematical functions, such as converting numbers between numeral systems, factorisation, solving Diophantine equations etc.

Full functionality list:
	 1) calculating factorials
	 2) calculating binominal coefficients ("n choose k")
	 3) checking whether a number triple is a Pythagorean triple
	 4) converting numbers from one numeral system to another (base up to 16)
	 5) checking whether a number is prime
	 6) number factorisation
	 7) providing a list of prime numbers less than a certain number
	 8) calculating the GCD of numbers
	 9) calculating the LCM of numbers
	10) solving Diophantine equations of type "ax + by = gcd(a,b)"
	11) solving congruencies of type "ax â‰¡ b (mod c)"
	12) finding one integer solution of Diophantine equations "ax + by = c"
	13) finding all solutions of Diophantine equations "ax + by = c"
